// The ${file} is a predefined variable that gives you the active file in your VScode tab.
// The following command ${ext##*.} is taking the biggest substring of a string (signle # would take the smallest part) until it meets the last period character. For example the name test.erb , would give you the output erb and the name test.txt would give you txt
// Now if the erb condition is met, then we should run htmlbeautifier with input and output the absolute path of the file
